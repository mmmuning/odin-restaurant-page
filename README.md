# Odin Restaurant Page

This project is part of **The Odin Project** (JavaScript / Webpack path). It’s a simple, dynamic restaurant website built entirely with JavaScript and DOM manipulation, following the project specification from the Odin curriculum.

## What This Project Includes

- A single-page webpage with **tabbed navigation**: Home, Menu, and Contact
- All page content: headers, sections, and menu items are **generated dynamically through JavaScript**
- Uses **ES6 modules** to organize the code (e.g. separate module for Home, Menu, Contact)
- Bundled with **Webpack** for asset management and development server
- Responsive and styled with semantic HTML and CSS

---

## What I Practiced and Demonstrated

- **DOM Manipulation**: Building out the entire UI by creating HTML elements via JS and appending them
- **Module Structure**: Separating logic into modules (Home, Menu, Contact) for clarity and maintainability
- **Webpack**: Using Webpack to bundle JavaScript modules and serve a development build
- **Single-page Navigation**: Tab switching logic to swap out the content of the app without full page reloads
- **Styling & Layout**: Using HTML5, CSS (flex, grid, or custom styles) in conjunction with JS-generated markup
- **Asset Management**: Handling images, CSS, and JS in a modular / bundled project
